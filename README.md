ITU Object Oriented Programming Lecture Assignment : 1

Description from project description pdf file :

"In this assignment, you are going to implement classes for two mathematical expressions: Polynomials and Vectors(do not confuse this with std::vector). These classes will hold necessary information to represent the data, and will also support some of the mathematical operations of these expressions: In Polynomial class, you will implement polynomial addition and multiplication and in Vector class, you will implement vector addition, scalar multiplication and dot product. You will also implement a user interface for users to perform operations with Polynomials and Vectors. More details are given below. As a reminder, following section gives basic explanations of polynomials and vectors, and how to perform the operations."
